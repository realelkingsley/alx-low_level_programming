Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers Write a function that convert a string to an integer. Prototype: int _atoi(char *s); The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0 You are not allowed to use long You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array You are not allowed to hard-code special values Your code needs to work on both ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code. If this flag is not available in you version of gcc, you can install the last version on your VM We will use gcc version 5 or above to compile 101-keygen.c
